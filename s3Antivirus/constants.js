 * CLAMAV_BUCKET_NAME: Name of the bucket where ClamAV and its definitions are stored
 * PATH_TO_AV_DEFINITIONS: Path in S3 where the definitions are stored. 3 files are expected (see CLAMAV_DEFINITIONS_FILES)
 *
 * The following variables can be overridden:
 *
 * STATUS_CLEAN_FILE: (default 'CLEAN') Tag that will be added to files that are clean.
 * STATUS_INFECTED_FILE: (default 'INFECTED') Tag that will be added to files that are infected.
 * STATUS_ERROR_PROCESSING_FILE: (default 'ERROR') Tag that will be added to files where the scan was not successful.
 * VIRUS_SCAN_STATUS_KEY: (default 'virusScanStatus') Name of the tag that indicates the status of the virus scan.
 * VIRUS_SCAN_TIMESTAMP_KEY: (default 'virusScanTimestamp') Name of the tag that indicates the time of the virus scan.
